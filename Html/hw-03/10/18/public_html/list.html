                        <dd>Bangladesh is one of the world's most densely populated countries,
                            with its people crammed into a delta of rivers that empties into the Bay of Bengal. </dd>
                        <dd>Poverty is deep and widespread,
                            but Bangladesh has in recent years reduced population growth and improved health and education.</dd>
                        <dd>Formerly East Pakistan, Bangladesh came into being only in 1971,
                            when the two parts of Pakistan split after a bitter war which drew in neighbouring India.</dd>
                        <dd>Bangladesh spent 15 years under military rule and,
                            although democracy was restored in 1990, the political scene remains volatile.</dd>
                        <dd>Islamist extremism has been rising in the usually tolerant country. </dd>
                        <dd>The low-lying country is vulnerable to flooding and cyclones, and stands to be badly affected by any rises in sea levels. </dd>

                        <dt style="font-size: 30px; color: orange;">India</dt>
                        <dd>India is the second most populous country in the world,
                            its largest democracy and home to vast diversity in geography,
                            climate, culture, language and ethnicity. Its civilization predates that of Europe.
                            India won independence from Great Britain in 1947 following protest of British rule led by Mohandas K. Gandhi.
                            Independence split British India into India and Pakistan,
                            resulting in continuing animosities complicated by both countries’
                            possession of nuclear weapons.</dd>
                        <dd>Economic reforms begun in 1991 led to rapid economic growth and a burgeoning high-tech industry.
                            Many have expressed hope that Hindu nationalist Narendra Modi, who was elected prime minister in 2014,
                            may begin to address the country’s continuing problems with widespread poverty, inequality,
                            an entrenched caste system, corruption, energy and infrastructure needs and sexual violence.</dd>

                        <dt style="font-size: 30px; color: green;">Pakistan</dt>
                        <dd>The Muslim-majority state of Pakistan was born out of the partition of the Indian sub-continent in 1947,
                            and has faced both domestic political upheavals and regional confrontations.</dd>
                        <dd>Created to meet the demands of Indian Muslims for their own homeland, Pakistan was originally made up of two parts.
                            The east wing - present-day Bangladesh - is on the Bay of Bengal bordering India and Burma. The west wing - present-day Pakistan - stretches from the Himalayas down to the Arabian Sea.
                            The break-up of the two wings came in 1971 when the Bengali-speaking east wing seceded with help from India.</dd>

                        <dt style="font-size: 30px; color: blue;">Sri Lanka</dt>
                        <dd>Lying off the southern tip of India, the tropical island of Sri Lanka has attracted visitors for centuries with its natural beauty.</dd>
                        <dd>But it has been scarred by a long and bitter civil war arising out of ethnic tensions between the majority Sinhalese and the Tamil minority in the northeast.
                            After more than 25 years of violence the conflict ended in May 2009, when government forces seized the last area controlled by Tamil Tiger rebels. But recriminations over abuses by both sides continue.
                            The island fell under Portuguese and Dutch influence after the 16th century. It gained independence in 1948, after nearly 150 years of British rule. </dd>
